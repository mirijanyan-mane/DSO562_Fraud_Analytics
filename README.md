Introduction

This Project was from my one of the classes from USC Marshall School of Business, DSO 562 - Fraud Analytics. It is an unsupervised machine learning problem where we were told to identify the outliers in the NYC Property valuation datatset who follow wrong practices in property tax filing. Principal component analysis and Autoencoder were used to solve the problem after proper handling of missing values and feature engineering.
